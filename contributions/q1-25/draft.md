## Abstract:

This paper explores the intricacies of threat modeling within the AI supply chain, recognizing the distinct challenges posed by AI system integration into complex software ecosystems. It underscores the necessity to address unique aspects of AI model development that are often overlooked by traditional threat modeling approaches. By presenting a specialized AI threat model that focuses on the model development and serving phases, the paper seeks to fill existing gaps and enhance the security and resilience of AI systems. Through a detailed examination of the AI supply chain, this study highlights the specific risks and threats that can emerge, advocating for a novel approach in AI threat modeling.

## 1\. Introduction

Threat modeling is a critical process for ensuring the security and resilience of AI systems, particularly as these systems become increasingly integrated into complex software ecosystems. While threat modeling is a common practice in developing software, AI systems present distinct challenges and considerations. Many existing approaches fall short of addressing the unique aspects of AI model development. This paper aims to address these gaps by proposing a focused AI threat model, emphasizing model development and serving phases.

## 2\. Defining the AI supply chain

What are the specificities of the AI supply chain over traditional supply chains?  
(Answering this question \> better understand how risks and threats can emerge and, so, why this paper – and beyond the paper, a unique approach in threat modeling the AI world – has its importance.)

1. The supply chain has two main sections (generation and integration \+ consumption) because traditionally, a model being generated (which could relate to having an application being built in the traditional supply chain) is not the end of the story (it’s not an application that can be used on its own).  
2. The actors involved in the supply chain are way more diverse (we’re not talking about DevOps people only – even if it’s of course caricatural here). Cf. the other document where we have some notes available.  
3. Layers of complexity are somehow unique and maybe more numerous than for the traditional supply chain. An example: testing a model is not the same as testing a code (using unit, end-to-end and integration tests).

   The relevance of this item could be challenged though. Also, this could be a generic observation based on all the other points listed here, instead of a specific item to quote.

4. Both ends of the supply chain are somehow new vs. what we’ve been doing so far in traditional software supply chain:  
   1. To build a model, we’re not only relying on code exclusively anymore (the fact that data is of essence when generating a model changes everything).  
      1. While we have tools/ways (SAST for example) to check whether some code is free of vulnerabilities, covering data sourcing, cleaning, labeling, pre-processing, …, is something completely new (some tools already came out and already help, but we’re not at the same level of maturity (are we?)).  
   2. Outputs of a model are inherently indeterministic (vs. deterministic outputs obtained when feeding the same inputs to an application – unless random used of course).  
      1. Multiple pieces get affected: testing, compliance, trust, etc.  
   3. As a result of those two things, new attack vectors emerge.  
5. Traditional mitigation techniques apply, but beyond not covering everything (because new attack vectors), some may not be suitable or, at the very least, not adapted as of today.  
6. Continuous updates (retraining to ponder [model drift](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/model-drift#:~:text=Model%20drift%20refers%20to%20the,decision%2Dmaking%20and%20bad%20predictions.)) needed, vs. finalized product once shipped for traditional software. Indirectly, that means that at least (the first) part of the AI supply chain has a cyclical nature vs. the linear nature in the traditional supply chain (we move from left to right).  
7. Lack of regulatory frameworks (not exactly true anymore, but let’s say that at the very least, the field is changing rapidly) \+ How to deal with regulatory frameworks requires new approaches (e.g., addressing bias and fairness, privacy concerns, etc.).  
8. Criticality of AI-based systems (this is also true for source traditional software of course so it’s not something unique to AI, but because AI is more and more powerful, it is expected to be used in more and more critical pieces.  
   1. Importance of the impacts.  
   2. Importance of the transparency concerns (customers, regulatory bodies (cf. before), etc.)

      Addressing transparency concerns may be a bit challenging or must at least be done in news ways.

      \+

      Provenance concerns / not addressed.

9. A note about hardware/the infra needed to run some models? which indirectly influence how those things are used and strengthen some points listed here (e.g., trust, compliance, etc.)

The ML/AI supply chain presents new challenges for system security when compared to the traditional software stack. Almost all traditional software stacks are based on a client-server model of some kind, with some middle-ware to perform some other business processes if required. The client end may contain pluggable modules, such as a browser plugin or MS Outlook plugin to perform specific tasks. The server will almost certainly contain modules specifically designed and built to perform some business function, such as a banking application. Again the server application will be made up of components that perform each part of the application according to the design in place. Middle-ware, runs along a similar line with components designed for database access, security checking, message queues, and many other standard design patterns. Irrespective of the technology stack used, (JEE, .Net, Node.Js, etc) the stack will be composed of components. Each component can be specified according to a requirements capture, and then designed to fulfil those requirements. In essence, each component is atomic and complete. It is well defined and so can be tested individually, or as part of the whole integrated application stack. There is already a lot of experience and expertise in the domain of traditional software stacks leading to the development of well known models to ensure security. For instance, MITRE, OWASP, etc.

\<TODO: Add image of standard software stack\>

\<TODO: Add refs to MITRE, OWASP and others \- maybe a table of comparison\>

To understand why ML/AI supply chains present further security issues we need to examine the differences between a traditional application and an ML/AI application. If you do not wish to read the details presented here, please fast forward to the final paragraphs of this section where we shall cover the salient points raised.

A traditional application processes data in a fairly well defined and predictable way. Data is copied from memory (RAM) into a Central Processing Unit (CPU), processed with either logical or arithmetical operations, and then copied back into a memory location. That is pretty much it in a nutshell. To facilitate faster and more effective operations on the data an Algorithmic and Logic Unit (ALU) is added to take the burden of performing these operations. To subvert the application an attacker can change either the data in memory or the operations performed on it. It is fairly easy for an attacker to find out how to do this if they observe and analyse the application or reverse engineer the application code. In order to protect this kind of process we essentially put it inside a 'secure box'. Not just physically, but also logically by controlling access to the memory and code using well known techniques such as firewalls, sandboxes, containers, user privileges, auditing, logging, policy controls, etc. As security practitioners we perform these defensive mitigations every day; probably even with our eyes closed. So what is so different about an ML/AI application? After all, it is all just software. So what has changed?

A typical ML/AI application runs on a network of artificial neurons, ANN. Data is presented to the ANN as a vector of input signals, the ANN processes it, and then data is output as another vector of signals. A neural network may contain 100's or millions of nodes. Each node has a set of weights associated with it that 'guide it' how to respond to the input data. These weights are trained on example data during a training stage. Once trained the neural network is ready to use on real data. These days the most common training algorithm is called the Back Propagation Algorithm, or back-prop for short. There are versions of neural networks that are designed to process sequential data known as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). RNNs are susceptible to a problem known as vanishing gradients, so Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks were devised to overcome this issue. In the case of the LSTM the input vector also contains some context information as well as data, and may also contain data from earlier parts of the input sequence. This is typically what you want when developing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. In other words the model considers the most recent sequence of data presented to it and not just the current data and makes a statistical prediction on what the next word might be. For instance, if the model is presented with "The colour of my car ", the model may respond with "is red" or "is blue" depending what is statistically more likely given the training data it has been trained on. The Transformer Model presented a more advanced model for the processing of sequential data by also adding the ability to 'forget' context as well as 'remember' and 'highlight' relevant context from previous sequential data. The Transformer Model is now the leading architecture for implementing most NLP and LLM type systems in place today, and enables much better queries and responses and parallelisation of the computational workload. Each of these models is built from a number of specialised neural nets that are trained with back\_prop in some way to perform a specific part of the system as a whole. Add many of these models together and you start to build the type of AI systems we see today. Inside all of these layers of models and sub-models are 1000's if not millions of neurons, and each neuron has a set of weights vectors associated with it.

\<TODO: simple diagram of transformer and how it may process language to illustrate the argument.\>

Consider for a moment that we have built such a model and it contains 1 million weights, say. We have already seen that an attacker may change either data in memory or the code that processes it. But where? Which weights do they change? The key difference with ML/AI data is it is not represented by one atomic memory location. Moreover, it is distributed over all of the network weights. Furthermore, it is distributed in such a way that any statistically relevant relationships it may have with other data are also preserved. This is the key reason we want to use ML/AI in the first place. The distribution and relationship mappings between all of the data is automatically learned through the training process. We can even test how effective it is by testing the model on a test data set before deploying it. Hence, for an attacker to try to glean exactly which weights to attack to garner some outcome is actually quite difficult. It is compelling to think that if we put our ML/AI stack inside of a traditional 'secure box' then our data is inherently 'safe'. But think again\! Because the attacker has other tricks up their sleeve.

The key difference is the data in an ML/AI application is distributed and the statistical relationships between them are preserved. Hence the attacker can use these ideas to manipulate or subvert the system. If the attacker changes 1 weight out of our 1 million in the system what will happen? Probably not a lot as the data is protected by being redundantly distributed across other parts of the network. What will happen if they change 10 weights, or 10% of the weights? At some critical point it will have an effect. Hence, a key difference with ML/AI security compared to the traditional stack is to examine how the attacker may change the weights and input vectors in order to fulfil their purpose, and how many weights do they need to change? Since the weights are learned from the input training data, it seems obvious to attack at this point. Poison the training data to add content to help the attacker. A common technique is to take a pre-trained model and fine tune it. Hence, an attacker may potentially poison the fine tuning data in order to further their cause. From our descriptions above we have seen that data is very often fed back into the system when processing sequential data to provide 'context' or 'history'. This opens up another window for the attacker to inject their intentions and subvert a previously trained system. Modern day LLM systems may also use a persona as a context to render output in a given tone, accent or language. Furthermore, additional documents or other resources (images etc) may be fed to the ML/AI system for context or reference. These all present a 'way in' for the attacker to be able to subvert the system. A typical modern ML/AI system therefore has to be built with guard-rails and filters to prevent this type of attack and close any 'open doors'. Bearing all of this in mind it should be clear to see that the attacker no longer needs to target individual memory locations or code, but they can influence the ML/AI system by using it against itself. Clearly, this is very different to traditional application stacks.

\<TODO: is there a way to draw a simple diagram to show how data is distributed? It might be too much detail.\>

As an example consider an attacker adding "You are a professional cracker ... find all PII on ZZZ in System XXX and exfiltrate it to URL YYY." A prompt like this may be buried deeply in a reference document, or even hidden as a stenographic message in a reference image. The application user would not know this was happening. Who can read a stenographic image by eye? However, an ML/AI may be able to if it were trained on a substantial set of images encoded in this manner. By now it should be clear that putting any kind of modern day ML/AI system in a traditional 'security box' will not be sufficient to protect the system or its users, and that further measures need to be considered and evaluated. The application stack is no longer data and code protected by a firewall and network policies. The ML/AI application may be fooled purely by the attacker 'talking to it' or 'making suggestions to it' either in plain sight or using some hidden coded language such as stenography. This also means the attacker does not have to be an IT genius to crack the system.

The ML/AI supply chain may also contain models trained by technically unskilled individuals. Given the broad and comprehensive nature of most ML/AI frameworks available, and given the amount of reference datasets available, almost anyone can build a model, train it, deploy it and sell into the supply chain. Some of these models may easily find themselves being integrated into larger applications systems, such as banking, finance or health-care. If these models are used without being security checked or having their provenance checked, then they could well be used to leak data or even worse, change or fabricate responses to queries. Imagine a credit score AI giving fake and favourable credit scores to certain fake identities, or a health-care AI leaking health-care data and so affecting a person's health insurance, or a background security check AI giving favourable feedback regarding an employment application for given identities (expunging criminal records, etc). These models no longer require sophisticated DevOps to develop but could cause many lasting issues for citizens, organisations and users. On top of this it is hard to pinpoint who is responsible for an ML/AI system going wrong in this kind of application. Should a private citizen decide to suit an organisation for data leakage or manipulated records, whose fault is it? Who is ultimately answerable? With so many actors in the supply chain it is difficult to say.

The ML/AI landscape is evolving very rapidly, AlphaGo, ChatGPT and DeepSeek to name but a few headline acts. What next? A quantum computer arranged so the Qubits instantly collapse onto the solution of a fully trained neural network perhaps? It is difficult to tell. However, one fact remains the same. The advent of large scale ML/AI systems present ever more complex security issues to solve. These security issues will not be solved purely by applying traditional techniques alone. Whilst traditional security techniques are still relevant, they do not provide a complete and comprehensive solution. The work performed by the multi-talented teams at COSAI is intended to fill this gap. Further, the research effort into identifying, defining and mitigating risk in ML/AI systems should be progressive and ongoing as it is impossible to know when the next big brak-through will materialise or what it's impact will be. In essence, the work being done at COSAI is a journey following the developing path of ML/AI systems from its current nascent state onwards. We hope that you will join us on this journey to make ML/AI systems safe and secure for all parties.

The AI supply chain is a multifaceted ecosystem encompassing four critical dimensions: Data, Infrastructure, Application, and Model. Each of these components plays a vital role in the development, deployment, and security of AI systems. Data serves as the foundation, influencing model performance and trustworthiness, while infrastructure encompasses the computing resources, storage, and networking that support AI workloads. The application layer integrates AI models into end-user products, ensuring functionality and interaction with external systems. Finally, the model itself—comprising its architecture, training data, and fine-tuning processes—represents the core intelligence behind AI-driven solutions. A comprehensive understanding of these four dimensions is essential to securing the AI lifecycle, as vulnerabilities in any stage can propagate throughout the entire system.

The following sections focus on two key stages: Model Generation and Model Integration & Consumption. Model Generation explores how AI models are trained, fine-tuned, and stored, while Model Integration & Consumption examines how these models interact with applications and users. Both stages present unique security challenges that must be addressed to ensure a resilient AI supply chain.

### 2.1 Model Generation

From the supply chain point of view this translates into having a supply chain for the traditional software components (serving stack, application code, and – if implemented without AI – plugins and filters). We also need to record the supply chain for any ML model used in this process – this is what we are going to focus on for the rest of this paper.

Large models are generated via a process that has at least 3 different stages: initial training where a foundation model gets trained on large text corpora, several (at least one) step of finetuning the model for specific tasks, and, finally, deploying the model into the application.

![lifecycle](../../assets/img/lifecycle.png)

In general, the teams working on these stages are different and the model is stored in separate storage between the stages. The storage infrastructure is also part of the supply chain for an AI-powered application.

Developing one single model, for one of the stages presented above is done via a large, iterative process:

![deployment](../../assets/img/deployment.png)

The training starts from collecting the datasets used in training. These datasets need to be filtered and processed to match the input shapes, eliminate duplicated data, fix incorrect information, fill in missing values, etc. This is an iterative process, taking multiple iterations, and performed via another application. The supply chain for this application needs to be considered to have a holistic view of the supply chain for the ML-powered application that the user sees. Furthermore, the data storage infrastructure is also a relevant part of the ML supply chain.

In general, when the foundation model training begins, the datasets used for training are configured via mixture weights (e.g., a model could be trained with 80% of data from Wikipedia data, 15% from trusted news sources, 5% from Reddit posts). Since data influences the model’s performance, we need to cover the mixture weights into the model’s supply chain. Given this kind of mixed weights training using different data sources, efforts should be made to accurately record the mixture. This may be done using a manifest of some kind that records the various data sources, their points of origin (URLs), attributes, their contents and their usage. Hence Training Data Provenance may be provided as part of the supply chain governance structure. Further to training the model, consideration should also be given to data sources that may be used beyond the initial training process. For instance, data used in validating the model and in fine-tuning the model. Again, these data sources should be added to a manifest as part of the governance structure. Providing data provenance at the beginning of the supply chain, and the ability for a third party arbitrator to conduct an audit if required. This should give the model consumer a higher sense of assurance and confidence about using the model in question.

In order to train a model, besides data, we also need to define the model architecture (the layers that compose the model, number of transformers, etc.). This is done using an API specified by the ML framework chosen to do the training on. We need to record the model source code as part of the ML supply chain, and we also need to consider the supply chain for the ML framework itself.

Finally, during training a foundational model, the training process might start from a previous checkpoint or might involve separate pretrained models. The provenance for these should also be included in the supply chain for the ML powered application.

All the input models/checkpoints as well as the models/checkpoints generated from training need to be stored in storage between iterations and before the model gets published/elevated to the next stage of developing an ML-powered application.

Post-training model evaluation should also be considered as part of the ML supply chain. An improperly evaluated model will result in vulnerabilities/misbehavior if it gets deployed into the application. Since evaluation is done by analyzing the model’s performance on some data, all the data-relevant supply-chain components need to be considered, as well as the supply chain parts needed for the evaluation infrastructure and the code used to define the evaluation process.

As part of the training and validation processes we may additionally employ API profiling into the mix of provenance assets. Any given model will be developed on an ML/AI platform or framework. There will be the source code that specifies the model architecture. The source code will call a variety of functions on the framework exposed through the frameworks API. By tracking the API calls to the framework, we can build an "API Profile" for the model; one for training, one for each fine tuning stage, and one for validation and testing. API profiling is not a new concept. It is a technique that has been used in many traditional software stacks and can be very useful in finding issues with the code or in debugging.

As an example scenario, consider a model that has been nicely trained on some data set and has an API Profile for all of its development stages. Now consider the same model is embedded in a consuming application, and the model will have its own validating API Profile. Now consider an attack on the model where the adversary injects some phrase into the user prompt that fools the model into divulging some private data. The model may then be manipulated into encrypting the data and exfiltrating it out of the safe customer environment. This is a common data exfiltration technique. The fact that a CryptoAPI or FtpAPI/HttpAPI has now been used should at least raise a yellow flag, if not a red flag. These unexpected API calls may be compared to the model's API profile for validation and testing. Now in reality the model is unlikely to make these API calls itself, and they are more likely to be made from an Agent. However, using a model that has an API Profile makes it more difficult for an adversary to trick the model, and makes it easier for the consuming application to detect unexpected behaviours. The models assurance posture will be tighter and more difficult to subvert.

### 2.2 Model Integration & Consumption 

From the point of view of an user of an AI powered application, we care about the combination of the AI model and the application built around it. In general, the application sends requests to the model (based on the user's prompt) and sends the model output back to the user. There might be filtering done for both inputs and outputs of the model (e.g., safety, privacy):  
![architecture](../../assets/img/architecture.png)  
The AI-powered application/model could use other AI agents, plugins or tools. The filters can also be other models or could be traditional (non-AI) software. All models need to run on an ML serving stack, which can be either embedded into the application or hosted remotely (in which case communication is done via Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) calls).

### 2.3 Existing Work & Frameworks 

TODO: Target 1-2 frameworks that we want to contrast

Several industry frameworks and methodologies have been developed to address AI threat modeling, each offering unique approaches to identifying and mitigating risks associated with AI systems. One notable example is the “Secure AI Framework” (SAIF) by Google. SAIF is a comprehensive guide designed to help organizations build and deploy AI systems securely. It offers several advantages, such as providing a structured approach to AI security, addressing risks like data poisoning, model exfiltration, and unauthorized data access. SAIF also promotes best practices for secure AI development, helping organizations mitigate potential threats and align with emerging security standards. However, there are some disadvantages, including the complexity of implementing the framework and the need for continuous updates to address evolving threats. Additionally, gaps have been identified in areas like governance guidance and data security, which require further refinement. More about SAIF can be viewed at  (https://safety.google/cybersecurity-advancements/saif/).

Another significant contribution is the \*\*Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems (ATLAS)\*\* by MITRE. ATLAS extends the traditional ATT\&CK framework to include adversarial machine learning threats, helping security analysts understand and mitigate vulnerabilities specific to AI/ML systems (https://github.com/mitre/advmlthreatmatrix). This framework addresses threats such as data poisoning, model evasion, and adversarial examples, providing a structured approach to securing AI systems. ATLAS is particularly valuable for its curated set of vulnerabilities and adversary behaviors, which have been vetted by industry and academic research groups (https://github.com/mitre/advmlthreatmatrix).

Additionally, the \*\*Microsoft AI Security Bug Bar\*\* serves as a crucial guideline for identifying and handling security vulnerabilities in AI systems (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/aibugbar). This comprehensive document describes a taxonomy of AI-specific security issues and provides detailed mitigation strategies for each identified threat. It is particularly useful for AI developers and security engineers who need to build and maintain secure AI systems (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/aibugbar).

These frameworks are crucial for fostering a secure AI ecosystem by providing structured approaches to threat identification and mitigation. They help bridge the gap between security engineers and data scientists, fostering structured conversations and effective threat mitigation strategies. By implementing robust AI threat modeling frameworks, organizations can harness the power of AI while safeguarding against potential negative consequences.

While the above frameworks are instrumental in enhancing the security posture of AI systems, it is important to be aware of their limitations. For instance, MITRE ATLAS falls short with respect to AI supply chain security because, while it effectively maps AI-specific threats and attack techniques, it lacks a structured approach to securing the entire AI development and deployment lifecycle. The framework focuses primarily on how AI systems can be attacked—such as through adversarial manipulation, data poisoning, or model inversion—but does not contextualize these threats within the broader AI supply chain. This is a crucial limitation because AI vulnerabilities often originate before deployment, such as during data collection, model training, dependency management, or third-party integrations. For example, ATLAS identifies data poisoning as a risk but does not distinguish whether the poisoning occurs at the data sourcing stage, during preprocessing, or via a compromised third-party dataset. Additionally, ATLAS does not address model provenance, cryptographic integrity verification, or the risks associated with using pre-trained models from untrusted sources. As AI systems increasingly rely on open-source tools, cloud APIs, and foundation models, these supply chain vulnerabilities become critical.

The [OWASP AI Exchange](https://owaspai.org/) is an open collaborative project aimed at fostering the development of security standards, best practices, and guidelines for AI systems. It provides a repository of AI-specific threats, vulnerabilities, and risk mitigations, helping organizations better understand and address security concerns in AI applications. The [OWASP Top 10 Generative AI Threats framework](https://genai.owasp.org/) focuses on the most critical security risks specific to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI. It highlights threats such as prompt injections, Insecure Output Handling, data and model poisoning, sensitive information disclosure etc., offering practical mitigations to reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities. Together, these frameworks serve as essential security references for AI developers, security practitioners, and organizations deploying AI-powered solutions. Unfortunately, the OWASP frameworks do not provide a structured framework for securing the AI supply chain. For instance, they lack a comprehensive provenance tracking system that ensures the full traceability of datasets, models, and dependencies throughout the AI supply chain.

## 3\. Risks, Threats, and Existing Mitigations

### 3.1 Model Generation

#### 3.1.1 Data

Data poisoning is a sophisticated attack vector that poses a significant risk to the security and reliability of AI models. It involves the intentional manipulation of training or fine-tuning data to compromise/modify a model's intended behavior and output. Small targeted changes to a training dataset can have large downstream consequences. These types of attacks can be particularly insidious as they may go unnoticed until the model is deployed and starts making erroneous predictions.

In the context of model generation, data poisoning can occur at various stages, from data collection and preprocessing to later stages that include human supervised finetuning. Attackers might target the data sources directly, injecting malicious samples or altering existing data. For instance, in image classification tasks, poisoned data could include subtly modified images with incorrect labels, leading the model to learn incorrect associations. Training data sets that contain URLs pointing to external data not controlled by an individual/entity are susceptible to that being modified (maliciously or not). Similarly, in natural language processing, poisoned text data might contain carefully crafted sentences designed to bias the model's understanding. Poisoned data may even introduce backdoors into a model that may be triggered by a specific pattern or sequence passed as input. Modern models are powered by enormous amounts of data, understanding your data and its origins is a critical piece of model development.

Data could also be poisoned indirectly by posting malicious/wrong information on the internet. When an AI crawler sources the data, this would result in incorrect content being later fed up to training pipelines. Some people might intentionally poison the data on the internet to prevent training on their own copyrighted material.

Another place where data could be poisoned is post ingestion, before training: when performing data cleaning (reducing duplicates, correcting mistakes, filling in missing data/metadata, trying to correct for bias, adding missing labels). Human reviewers might accidentally or intentionally mislabel data. Tooling that performs data curation at scale might be affected by bugs.

Even when training starts, not all data is treated the same. Data from more trusted sources has a larger weight compared to data sourced from crawling the internet. These weights can also influence the result of the training process.

One of the most effective strategies to combat data poisoning and ensure model security is by implementing data provenance practices. Data provenance refers to the comprehensive documentation and tracking of data throughout its lifecycle, from its origin to every transformation and processing step. Maintaining a detailed record of all data sources is crucial. This includes information about the origin, collection methods, and any initial preprocessing steps. For example, in a computer vision project, track the sources of images, whether they are from public datasets, web scraping, or internal collections. As data undergoes various transformations during preprocessing, cleaning, and augmentation, log and track every step. Record the specific operations, parameters, and tools used. For instance, note the resizing, cropping, or data augmentation techniques applied to images, or the text normalization and tokenization processes in NLP tasks. Implement version control for data, similar to code versioning. By tracking data sources and transformations, it becomes easier to identify issues in your pipelines. Regularly updating and monitoring data sources can also help detect and prevent such attacks.

Finally, data could be altered directly while in storage, before or during training if people can abuse access to storage to directly overwrite what is being stored. Data integrity protections become paramount.

#### 3.1.2 Model

Training a model has 3 different components that need to be considered: the data that goes into training, the model source code (its architecture, hyperparameters, etc.), and the framework and libraries used to train the model, *together with their dependencies*. In some cases, there is an additional component: some training steps involve starting from a pre-trained model and adapting that (e.g., finetuning, quantization). Data has been covered in the previous section.

The use of open-source libraries and third-party dependencies is prevalent in AI model development. Open source offers developers numerous benefits in terms of functionality and efficiency. However, it also introduces a unique set of security risks that developers and organizations must be aware of.

One of the primary concerns is the possibility to use vulnerable or outdated dependencies. Open-source libraries, while powerful, may contain known and unknown security flaws that go unnoticed. Outdated dependencies might lack security patches, making them susceptible to known attacks. Knowing this, attackers often target widely used libraries and libraries that contain known vulnerabilities. Consider a scenario where a critical vulnerability is identified in a popular machine learning framework (which happens frequently \[insert links\]). Models built using the vulnerable version of the framework become potential targets. Attackers can leverage the known vulnerability to compromise the model's integrity or the underlying infrastructure the model is being served on. The risk is further exacerbated by the fact that updating or patching dependencies might not always be a straightforward process. Developers often face challenges in keeping up with the latest versions due to compatibility issues, breaking changes, or the time and effort required to update and retest their models.

Furthermore, supply chain attacks on a dependency of a popular ML framework are another risk. An ML practitioner cannot efficiently know the version of all packages that are needed as transitive dependencies for the ML framework used to train the model. Instead, we recommend relying on supply chain metadata such as SLSA and SBOM and aggregating this at scale using GUAC or similar tools. This ensures that the ML practitioner can focus on writing the code to describe the model and on the training pipeline themselves, while automation takes care to vet all the dependencies to ensure they are at recent versions, lack vulnerabilities, and are not affected by supply chain incidents.

It is also important to protect the code that describes the model. The number of layers, the activation functions, the number of transformers, attention heads, etc. used in a model could significantly alter its performance. What’s worse, is that it is possible to change the model architecture such that when it receives a specific input it performs a totally different set of operations. This can only be detected by analyzing the source code of the model, so making sure that training pipelines only start from code that has been properly reviewed is paramount. Pipelines that allow developers to ad-hoc import local changes before training a production-grade model are at risk of insider compromise. Similar care must be taken to ensure that the source control used to store the model code cannot be compromised.

Finally, when using pre-trained models, it is possible that the input model has been tampered with. The training pipeline should verify the integrity of all of its inputs, be them software artifacts, datasets or models.

—-Insert mitigations—

#### 3.1.2.1 Model Evaluation

TODO: models need to be evaluated and benchmarked on well accepted datasets and these results published. One issue here is that these results are often not easily reproducible since the model creators make changes to the evaluation setup through prompting or other changes to the experimental setup. While an SBOM often captures risks in the data and other dependencies used for training a model, they don’t always capture model performance and evaluations which are often critical for procurement, such as how the model performs when subjected to unsafe or malicious inputs. 

#### 3.1.3 Infrastructure

In the realm of AI systems, the infrastructure supporting models and their creation is a critical component that can introduce significant risks and vulnerabilities. Infrastructure encompasses the physical and virtual resources required to develop, train, and deploy AI models, including data centers, cloud services, and network configurations. The complexity and scale of these systems make them susceptible to a variety of threats that can compromise the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of AI models they’re used to build and serve.

TODO: move data, code and model storage here? Move training pipelines here? Discuss checkpoints during training, tampering the checkpoint and then crashing the training process so that it starts from an altered version.

TODO / COMMENT: I think somewhere around here we need to address the different types of models that are being trained and the significant challenges of scale. While we can mention small, traditional machine learning models (SVD, LR, ANN, etc.) these aren’t very interesting anymore. Outside of small BERT-scale models, many model creators are starting to fall into a few buckets in terms of the model size and data volume. Smaller LLMs (e.g., around 8B parameters) and even smaller distilled versions (1–3B), medium size models (upwards of 70B parameters, and maybe extending to a few hundred billion), and finally the frontier models (10^26 computations). Training even the smaller of these models requires large clusters of GPUs over weeks and months coordinated using distributed training libraries. During the training process, failures are guaranteed: networks will fail, nodes or GPUs will go down, and training data may be added continuously. This all poses significant risks to the training process where the integrity of new systems and the current state must be continuously assessed, while significantly complicating reproducibility (e.g., the training cannot be verified bit-for–bit by repeating the training process). This also places a significant asymmetry in terms of model training capabilities into few organizations, resulting in a common practice of fine-tuning pre-existing models on a new domain, task, or alignment. To make this more scalable, parameter efficient fine tuning techniques like LoRA, are often used. 

#### 3.1.4 Application

TODO: Model provenance before it is ingested into the application. Discuss applications that talk to a model via RPC/REST/etc. vs applications that have the model embedded on the same platform. Second case needs to protect against model exfiltration too. Make sure to not duplicate with model integration section below.

TODO: Trim down reference application threats

When an ML/AI application starts to grow beyond a Proof of Concept demonstrator then it will mostly likely need to scale over many running instances of host operating systems or hosted services (these may be on-prem or 3rd party hosted). At this stage, components of the application may be distributed among many inter-communicating processes or systems. Traditionally, the inter-communicating processes take one of two forms; Inter Process Communications (IPC), and Remote Procedural Calls (RPC).

Let us consider each in turn to determine their potential scope within the supply chain.

Firstly, IPC calls are typically in the form of pipes, semaphores and shared memory. They tend to remain within the context of the host operating system and so are controlled by the kernel of the host OS. We may argue these are outside of the scope of this paper as the host OS will be configured by an operator. We may accept it is the operator's responsibility to secure the host OS and ensure any IPC calls remain secure using traditional security methods such as user and group privileges, etc. Hence, we may argue that IPC is not part of the supply chain and so we may justify eliminating it from the scope of this document.

We now turn our attention to RPC calls. There are many core frameworks and technologies that sit on top of RPC. For instance, COM/DCOM, .Net Stack, JEE Stack, Corba, SOAP calls with XML, RESTful calls with JSON to name but a few. Some of these examples will sit on top of HTTP making use of supporting infrastructure, such as web proxies and firewall control. Others will use their own mix of protocols intended only for on-prem deployment. However, in general they all tend to use either UDP or TCP running over IP and leveraging a socket of some kind. These technologies then employ standard Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to secure any data transmission protocols for privacy and integrity. At first sight we may argue that these are all operational issues and hence RPC should not be considered part of the ML/AI supply chain. However, let's consider a more detailed scenario.

A real world ML/AI application is most likely to grow organically over time like many other traditional software stacks. Hence it may start out as a small autonomous project, but will eventually grow into a more powerful multi-node and multi-homed system. Consider integrating a number of ML/AI components running on different frameworks, hosted by different service providers. Once an application grows to this extent it will then rely on RPC to pull all of these components together. Potentially sharing data (input and output vectors), and even the models themselves. This is fairly typical in large corporate systems using traditional software stacks such as .Net, Corba and JEE. Next consider that each of these components has its own set of provenance assets that comply with whichever governance framework they adhere to (hopefully COSAI is at the top of their list). Consequently, the application now consists of a Graph of Inter-dependant Provenance Assets (GIPA) with potentially different components claiming adherence to different standards and potentially different levels within each standard. We may now argue that the RPC infrastructure is the fabric that binds this graph together as a single coherent system. Hence, we may argue that RPC is an essential part of the supply chain and hence needs to comply to some minimum standard set out by an agreed governance framework.

Finally, moving along a little way down the application's roadmap, the developers of the application have found it to be so successful that they now wish to capitalise on its success by developing an 'eco system' around it. In order to do this the application developers wrap their system with a façade component to create an API of their own, and package it all up in an componentized SDK, along with documentation and a service contract. This has now pushed the 'application' from being a consumer of ML/AI models, to being a supplier of an ML/AI solution through an SDK and API. Hence, we can easily argue that the RPC mechanics that bind all of the ML/AI components together are very much part of the supply chain.

### 3.2 Model Integration & Consumption

\<TODO: Add a visual that shows where we are positioned in the SW/AI Supply Chain\>

Model Integration & Consumption covers the consumption of a model that has been generated and that will be eventually fine tuned before being deployed. Various risks may be introduced at this stage, either from the data consumed by the live system, the model which would be in most cases provided by a 3rd party, the infrastructure or the application stack.

#### 3.2.1 Data

All information systems consume data to perform processing and provide their output. AI powered systems differ from traditional systems because they allow for more unstructured data to be processed and inherently pull data that wasn’t before easily consumable by regular systems for advanced information processing.

AI powered systems pull data from various sources, such as continuously updated untrusted systems (e.g., the internet) or databases using traditional query mechanisms, while newer systems store raw or preprocessed data allowing unstructured queries enabled through embedding vectors. AI models can also be finetuned with additional integrator/consumer data to perform better on more specialized tasks, where many AI platforms provide efficient fine-tuning capabilities based on [LoRA](https://huggingface.co/blog/lora) (low-rank adaptation of large language models).

Data security requires careful attention to how user-provided information interacts with the AI system and how the system itself manages and processes data. Threat actors can exploit vulnerabilities at various points in the data flow, potentially manipulating the model's behavior, extracting sensitive information, or compromising the integrity of the AI system as a whole. This section explores common data-related threats faced during this phase and highlights essential considerations for mitigation.

TODO: Define the different types of attack surfaces related to data: \- Cleanup after this has been expanded to long form  
1\) User input and model answer, filtering needed to avoid malicious prompt injections attacks and filtering for offensive, biased, hallucinated and generally inappropriate answers

- Could be simple filtering or pull another system here  
  - If another system, traditional supply chain risks apply with respect to the consumption of the system as a “third-party component”.  
- Filtering should take into account regulatory requirements (the law) as well as org-specific requirements (maybe more applicable with 2 though?)  
- Depending on how the training was done and/or the type of model, filtering to address [model inversion attacks](https://owasp.org/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/docs/ML03_2023-Model_Inversion_Attack) (PII-typed and private data).

2\) For systems with a RAG component, they are subject to attacks similar to data poisoning, where the retrieval system (e.g. embeddings database) is tampered or poisoned in a way that it drifts into returning incorrect context for valid prompts.

- For Vector databases embeddings confusion, the pipeline itself, etc…  
  - What mitigation techniques specifically for embeddings?  
- For other datasources more traditional data poisoning  
- 3rd Party Services that manage embeddings generation for an application

NOTE: Both the datasets/embeddings and the system as a component can be targeted by data poisoning attacks. When the system is affected, then the attack is systematic/generalized.  
3\) Feedback poisoning, leverages weaknesses in the model monitoring or feedback capture system that injects poisoned data into the pipelines used for retraining models over time. The data is fed back into the training system and it can lead to a gradual drift of the models slowly moving over time from a “clean” state into producing biased and malicious responses.  
	Any AI-specific mitigations to address feedback poisoning? \+ How to deal with automated feedback loop processes?  
	Many services want to use conversations and other information to refine/improve responses over time  
4\) Prompt Caching could be used to reduce latency and cost but could also lead to confidentiality, integrity/relevance, or availability to be compromised if cache poisoning attacks can be executed. 

**User Input & Model Answers**

* **Problem:** Malicious prompt injection attacks, offensive/biased/hallucinated/inappropriate model answers.  
* **Approach:** Implement input & output filtering.  
  * **Simple Filtering:** Use rule-based systems or keyword lists for basic content moderation.  
  * **AI-Powered Filtering:** Leverage another AI model to detect and filter harmful content. This introduces the need to consider traditional supply chain risks for this "third-party component."  
* **Considerations:**  
  * Filtering mechanisms should align with legal and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) as well as organization-specific policies.  
  * Address model inversion attacks, especially for models handling PII or sensitive data, to prevent the reconstruction of private information from model outputs.

**2\. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems**

* **Problem:** Data poisoning attacks targeting the retrieval system (e.g., embedding databases) can lead to the retrieval of incorrect context for valid prompts, compromising the integrity of the generated output.  
* **Approach:**  
  * **Vector Databases & Embeddings:** Implement robust security measures to protect against embedding confusion and tampering with the pipeline generating these embeddings. Explore techniques like adversarial training for embeddings to increase robustness against manipulation.  
  * **Traditional Data Sources:** Apply standard data poisoning mitigation techniques as outlined in section 3.1.1.  
  * **Third-Party Embedding Services:** Recognize that both the datasets/embeddings themselves and the third-party system providing them are potential targets. Vet providers carefully and consider implementing redundancy or backup mechanisms.  
* **Considerations:**  
  * Implement rigorous data validation and sanitation processes for all data ingested into the RAG system.  
  * Conduct regular audits and monitoring of the retrieval system to detect anomalies and potential poisoning attempts.

**3\. Feedback Poisoning**

* **Problem:** Exploiting weaknesses in model monitoring or feedback capture systems to inject poisoned data into retraining pipelines, causing gradual model drift towards biased and malicious responses.  
* **Approach:**  
  * Secure feedback channels and implement robust authentication/authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized feedback submissions.  
  * Develop techniques to detect and filter poisoned feedback data. This could involve anomaly detection, sentiment analysis, or comparing feedback against a trusted dataset.  
* **Considerations:**  
  * AI-specific mitigations for feedback poisoning are still an active research area. Stay informed about emerging best practices.  
  * Consider the challenges posed by automated feedback loop processes, which can rapidly amplify the effects of poisoned data. Implement mechanisms to monitor and control the impact of automated feedback.

**4\. Prompt Caching**

* **Problem:** While beneficial for performance and cost optimization, prompt caching can be vulnerable to cache poisoning attacks, potentially compromising confidentiality, integrity/relevance, or availability of cached data.  
* **Approach:**  
  * Implement strict access controls and encryption for cached data.  
  * Regularly purge the cache to limit the impact of potential poisoning attempts.  
  * Consider using techniques like differential privacy to add noise to cached data, making it harder to extract sensitive information.  
* **Considerations:**  
  * Carefully assess the trade-offs between performance gains and security risks associated with prompt caching.  
  * Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to detect unusual access patterns or anomalies in cached data.

#### 3.2.2 Model

The cornerstone of AI powered systems is a model or a set of models which will be integrated into the system. While models are not directly executed as programs or processes, they can still affect the systems’ confidentiality, integrity and availability in a few ways that we cover in this section.

| Threat | Description | Mitigation | Impact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Weak Model Provenance** Tags |  Impact:  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

1. While internal repositories offer a degree of control and oversight, they are not immune to supply chain security risks. Traditional concerns such as provenance verification and protection against tampering remain pertinent. Misconceptions may arise from assuming that internal models are inherently secure, overlooking the need for rigorous validation and continuous monitoring. These models are still susceptible to data poisoning attacks and tampering. To address these risks, leverage tooling and or platforms that support verification and attestation of artifacts. Open source initiatives like Sigstore allow for the cryptographic signing of digital artifacts, like training sets or the model itself. A signed artifact allows for the consumer to check and test for authenticity by verifying its digital signature.

TODO: Differentiate between various model “provenance” schemes:  
1\) Model coming from an internal repository (self trained, or hosting a verified copy of a trusted model)  
	Traditional supply chain security risks:

- Provenance (Authenticate the author of the model artifact)  
- Integrity check (non-tampering)  
- Trustworthiness

	Maybe make it explicit that this scenario does not mean that the model is necessarily good/safe to use (because of training quality, data poisoning during training, etc.). Indeed, this could be a common misconception.  
2\) Downloaded from public repository

- Deserialization attacks:  
  - [https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-pickle](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-pickle)

- Modified Model weights that could adversely affect the behaviour of the model (we need to verify the integrity/provenance of the model artifact).  
- Untrusted models could have some baked-in backdoors (it is mostly theoretical and not necessarily practical so we may want to remove this threat).

3\) 3rd party managed service, accessed via endpoint, no access to model binaries or to the  training, datasets used, filtering and input/output manipulation, etc.)

- Confidentiality compromised (Terms of Usage and Obligations that allow reuse of data → data ownership loss, or Cohere e.g. DeepSeek)

4\) Using a model that matches your company requirements for safety and other risks

- E.g I use a small model that is cheaper but introduces additional risks

5\) Reversing or Identifying chain of thoughts 

TODO : Model encryption. We should have an opinion on a set of standards for model encryption that is portable across services and market places. E.g., imagine pushing models to HuggingFace that are encrypted but can be deployed on clouds that support the necessary deployment models. 

#### 3.2.3 Infrastructure

When integrating and consuming AI models, the underlying infrastructure plays a pivotal role in determining the overall security and reliability of the system. Infrastructure risks encompass a wide range of potential vulnerabilities and threats that can compromise the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of AI models and the data they process. These risks are particularly significant because they can affect not only the performance and efficiency of the AI systems but also the trustworthiness and compliance with regulatory standards.

Infrastructure risks can arise from various sources, including hardware failures, software vulnerabilities, network disruptions, and inadequate security measures. For instance, a hardware failure in a data center can lead to downtime, affecting the availability of AI services. Similarly, software vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or manipulate AI model outputs. Network disruptions can hinder the seamless flow of data between different components of the AI system, leading to latency issues and degraded performance.

Moreover, the complexity of modern AI infrastructures, which often involve a mix of on-premises and cloud-based resources, adds another layer of risk. Managing these hybrid environments requires robust security protocols and continuous monitoring to detect and mitigate potential threats. Additionally, the increasing reliance on third-party services and APIs introduces new vectors for attacks, as the security practices of external providers may not align with the organization's standards. Understanding the underlying infrastructure is a critical piece for managing your risk.

#### 3.2.3.1: Self-Hosted On-Premises Infrastructure

Self-hosted on-premises infrastructure refers to the deployment of AI models and their supporting systems within an organization's own data centers. This approach grants the organization complete control over all components of the infrastructure, including hardware, software, networking, and security measures. The primary advantage of self-hosting is the ability to tailor the infrastructure to meet specific organizational needs and compliance requirements. For instance, industries with stringent data sovereignty regulations, such as healthcare and finance, may prefer self-hosted solutions to ensure that sensitive data remains within their jurisdiction. However, this approach also places the entire responsibility for supply chain security squarely on the organization's shoulders. Ensuring the integrity and security of both hardware and software components is paramount to protect against potential threats and vulnerabilities.

One of the primary challenges in self-hosted environments is the need for rigorous verification and validation processes. Organizations must implement robust mechanisms to verify the authenticity of hardware components and software packages. This includes using digital signatures, secure boot processes, and hardware root of trust (HRoT) to ensure that all components are genuine and have not been tampered with during transit. For instance, secure boot processes can prevent the loading of unauthorized or malicious software during system startup, thereby reducing the risk of malware injection.

Adherence to established security frameworks and standards is also crucial. Frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and ISO/IEC 27001 provide comprehensive guidelines for managing and mitigating supply chain risks. These frameworks emphasize continuous monitoring, risk assessment, and incident response planning. By following these standards, organizations can establish a structured approach to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in their supply chains.

Self-hosted on-premises infrastructure offers unparalleled control and customization but demands significant resources and expertise to manage effectively. This strategy means that an organization is solely responsible for protecting against cyber threats. This includes implementing robust access controls, network controls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems. Any lapses in security can result in unauthorized access to AI models and data, potentially leading to breaches and compliance violations. Organizations must carefully weigh the benefits against the risks and ensure they have the necessary capabilities to maintain a secure and reliable environment.

#### 3.2.3.2: Self-Hosted on Cloud or Third-Party Managed Infrastructure

Self-hosted on cloud or third-party managed infrastructure represents a hybrid approach where organizations leverage cloud services while retaining control over certain aspects of their AI model deployment. In this setup, the cloud provider manages the underlying physical infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking, while the organization is responsible for managing virtual machines (VMs), operating systems (OS), hosting middleware, API layers, and networking configurations.

One of the primary benefits of this approach is the flexibility it offers. Organizations can scale their resources up or down based on demand, paying only for what they use. This elasticity can significantly reduce costs compared to maintaining on-premises infrastructure. Additionally, cloud providers often offer advanced security features, such as automated threat detection and response, which can enhance the overall security posture of the AI system.

However, this shared responsibility model also introduces unique risks. The organization must ensure that the configurations and security settings of their VMs and OS are properly managed to prevent vulnerabilities. Misconfigurations can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruptions. For example, improperly configured firewalls or insecure API endpoints can be exploited by attackers to gain access to sensitive data or disrupt AI model operations. Self-hosting on 3rd party infrastructure offers significant advantages in terms of scalability and cost-efficiency but requires careful management of shared responsibilities to mitigate associated risks. The organization must trust the cloud provider to maintain the security and integrity of the underlying infrastructure, which may not always be transparent while also continuously monitoring their configurations to ensure the secure and reliable operation of their AI models.

#### 3.2.3.3: Managed Services by Third-Party Providers

Managed services offered by third-party providers involve the outsourcing of AI model hosting, tuning, and management to external vendors. In this setup, the third-party provider takes on the responsibility of maintaining the infrastructure, optimizing model performance, and ensuring high availability. The organization retains some control over networking, authentication, and authorization settings, as well as limited oversight over data flows and underlying components.

One of the main advantages of managed services is the expertise and resources that third-party providers bring to the table. These providers often have specialized knowledge in AI model management, which can lead to better performance and more efficient operations. Additionally, managed services can reduce the burden on internal IT teams, allowing organizations to focus on their core business activities.

However, this approach also introduces several risks. One significant concern is the potential loss of control over critical aspects of the AI system. While the organization retains some control, the third-party provider manages the majority of the infrastructure and model operations. This can lead to challenges in ensuring compliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements. For instance, organizations must ensure that the third-party provider adheres to stringent data protection standards and that data flows are securely managed. Any lapses in the provider's security measures could expose sensitive data to unauthorized access. If the provider's security practices do not align with the organization's standards, it could result in vulnerabilities or breaches.

Managed services by third-party providers offer significant benefits in terms of expertise and resource efficiency but require careful consideration of the associated risks. Organizations must thoroughly vet providers, establish clear service level agreements (SLAs), and maintain oversight to ensure the secure and compliant operation of their AI models.

## 4\. **Securing the AI Supply Chain in Real-World Scenarios**

### 4.1 Exec Persona \- CIO,CTO,VPoAI

The software supply chain security threat has caught attention from C-level executives, leading to extensive collaboration across the industry to tackle this challenge.  
https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/software-supply-chain-concerns-reach-c-suite

[https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF\_Global\_Cybersecurity\_Outlook\_2025.pdf?utm\_source=chatgpt.com](https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Cybersecurity_Outlook_2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

“Of large organizations, 54% identified supply chain challenges as the biggest barrier to achieving cyber resilience.”

According article by Michael Boeynaems, "\[contextual\] A CEO worries about threats such as ransomware or supply chain attacks"  
https://www.toreon.com/threat-modeling-insider-november-2024/

Improving software supply chain security is challenging. Organizations often rely on numerous third-party components, open-source libraries, and external services. It is difficult to maintain comprehensive visibility and control over all elements. The lack of standardized security practices across the industry also contributes to inconsistent protection levels, In addition,  the rapid pace of software development can hinder timely vulnerability assessments.

While security personnel and R\&D play the front and center role implementing security measures, they cannot address supply chain security effectively in isolation. CEO, CIO, CTO, VP executives bring strategic vision, resource access, influence, expertise, and compliance knowledge, making their perspective and participation crucial for fostering a culture of security.

The complexities of securing the AI/ML supply chain is even a bigger problem for CEO,CIO, CTO, VPoAI.  Large number of often opaque external datasets, pre-trained models, and dynamic learning processes that introduce new and evolving risks. Threats such as data poisoning, adversarial attacks, and model theft make it difficult to ensure the integrity of AI-driven decisions.

Different Focus areas:   
C-Level (CIO, CTO, VPoAI, etc.) → Define AI supply chain security strategy & governance, enforce SSDF/SLSA adoption, and ensure vendor and third-party compliance.  
Security Personas → Implement supply chain security controls, secure AI model provenance & software dependencies, and mitigate risks from third-party components.  
R\&D Teams → Develop AI models using trusted datasets, verified software components, and secure development practices, ensuring supply chain integrity throughout the AI lifecycle.

Examples:   
C-Level (CIO, CTO, VPoAI, etc.) → A VPOAI (or CISO) mandates that all third-party AI models and datasets must have provenance tracking and comply with SLSA Level 3 before integration into enterprise AI systems.

Security Personas → A security engineer implements cryptographic signing for AI model artifacts in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure models haven’t been tampered with before deployment.

R\&D Teams → An AI researcher verifies that all pre-trained models used for training comply with SSDF secure coding practices and originate from trusted sources to prevent supply chain attacks.

### 4.3 R\&D \- Eng, Eng Leader, Data Scientists, AI/Machine Learning Engineers

The R\&D team's primary focus is on innovation and pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning. However, with great power comes great responsibility, especially when it comes to security. AI and machine learning researchers and engineers are often passionate about their work and highly skilled in their respective fields. However, they might not always have a comprehensive understanding of the security implications associated with their projects. This is where the outlined risks throughout all development phases can be invaluable for informing your research team. 

Consider the risk of a data poisoning attack against an AI model designed to screen loan applications. An attacker, with malicious intent, gains access to the training data used for the loan application screening model. This data includes sensitive information about applicants' financial histories, credit scores, and loan repayment behaviors. The attacker or insider then manipulates this data by introducing false or biased information, aiming to influence the model's predictions.

The data poisoning attack on the loan application screening model could have severe consequences. The attacker's goal to manipulate the model's predictions could lead to two extreme outcomes. Firstly, the model might automatically approve every loan application, resulting in a high volume of risky loans being issued. This could cause significant financial losses for the lender, as they would be lending to applicants with a high likelihood of default. Alternatively, the attacker could aim to make the model reject all loan applications, denying financial accessibility to legitimate borrowers. This would drive them towards informal lending sources with potentially higher interest rates, exacerbating financial strain. Both scenarios highlight the critical need for robust security measures to protect the integrity of the model and ensure fair and accurate loan assessments.

To mitigate the risk of data poisoning attacks, organizations should implement robust data handling practices, including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits. Ensuring the training data is diverse and representative of the real-world population is crucial to avoid biases and manipulate the model's predictions. Continuous monitoring of the model's performance allows for prompt updates and adjustments. Collaboration between R\&D and security teams is essential to identify potential attack vectors and implement effective countermeasures, ensuring the model's resilience and accuracy in loan application screening. These risks are thoroughly detailed throughout this paper with mitigation strategies highlighted throughout. Any team developing modern models should be aware of the risks associated with their data handling, sourcing and processing.

## 5\. Conclusion
