# Workstream 1: Software Supply Chain Security for AI Systems

## Purpose
This roadmap intends to define the short, medium, and long term deliverables and objectives of this workstream as well as identify sub-groups that will go in depth and contribute to their surrounding ecosystems. Building on the RFC process of this workstream we will identify where we can contribute to standards or tools in the short term in order to prioritize our efforts.
